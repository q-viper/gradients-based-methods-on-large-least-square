# gradients-based-methods-on-large-least-square
Some codes and experiments I did as a part of Master's seminar titled as Comparing Different Gradient Based Schemes on Large Least Squared Problems

## Modules
### Matplotlib_vis
* Plotting everything in matplotlib.

### Webapp
* Uses streamsync.

## To Do
[ ] Re-organize code in appropriate manner. (Currently data classes and configs are within same fiel. Its really a bad habit....)
[ ] Web app.
